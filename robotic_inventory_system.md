A 3d printable modular inventory management system.

Key features:
 - Each container can clip/slide into other containers.
 - Containers come in a complete range of sizes.
 - Containers can be printed with a 1mm nozzle for rapid production.
 - The containers are specified so that a small robot can transvers the modules without needing a
   large gantry.
 - The containers are both human and machine handleable.
 - Mechanical features allow the robot to detect which way it can travel (ie map the storage systems structure)
 - Containers are a single part - they don't have an "inner" and "outer" the way most modular
   drawers do. Instead they slide on their neighbours.
